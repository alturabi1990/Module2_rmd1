## R Markdown

### This is level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [google](http://google.com)

Here is a word in __bold__ and an other in **bold**

Here is a word in _Italics_ and an other in *Italics*

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package 

Here are some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```


Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice
    
Here is an example of a numbered list:

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice
 
Here is an example of a blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.


Here is an example of a nested blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > This text is nested


Here is an example of code in a blockquote:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


## Insert tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "Top 6 rows of car dataset")
```


## Insert equation

$$  y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$



## insert image 

Here is an image inserted

## insert text with some footnotes

here is reference footnote [^1] and another [^longnote]

Here is an inline footnote ^[inline note are easier to write, since no need to pick an identifier ]

[^1]: here is the footnote
[^longnote]: here is one with multiple blocks
